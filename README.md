This is the source code for chris-poulles.com, the website of cinematographer Chris Poulles. It consists of handlebars template, Javascript modules and SCSS styles that get combined with content from contentful.com by a Webpack build process. The resulting "static" website is hosted on now.sh. All of this is orchestrated by the Github actions in this repository.
